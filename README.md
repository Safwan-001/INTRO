-  Did you know that dinosaurs didn't even exist? a few scientists didn't accept the proposal of estimated existence of Dinosaurs and they were sued later on, removed from the media so that we people would be unaware. Possibly the scientists who claim dinosaurs to be true are accredited and they boastfully, might brag about their researches but hey, the world is millions of years old, and besides the 2000th number of years we passed, we now nothing about the mysteries of pyramids and their architectural excellency without 'so called modern equipments'...
There's more than meets the eye... anyway
